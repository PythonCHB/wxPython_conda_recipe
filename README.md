# wxPython_conda_recipe
repo to play with conda recipes for wxpython (and phoenix)

The goal here is to push these recipes to conda-forge at some point:

https://conda-forge.github.io/

But it's helpful to have a place to develop them and make sure they work before getting entangled with the conda-forge infrastructure.

Please feel free to test and contirbute patches!
